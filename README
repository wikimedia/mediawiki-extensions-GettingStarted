extensions/GettingStarted
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GettingStarted

The GettingStarted extension
* Maintains lists of pages that need easy editing work based on article
  categories such as 'Category:All articles needing copy edit'
* Creates a new API, GettingStartedGetPages.  This can recommend an article
  that needs work, based on the above lists
* If the user chooses a task, it shows an article in that category with a taskbar
  that
  - invites the user to fix the article,
  - offers to show help (using guided tours),
  - links to another article in the same task.

To use:
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once( "$IP/extensions/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.php" );
* Categorize some wiki articles in the main namespace with the categories in
  $wgGettingStartedCategoriesForTaskTypes.
* Create a new user to test.

CentralAuth (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CentralAuth) is supported,
but not required.

CirrusSearch is optional, but required if you use the 'morelike' suggestion type
(pages similar to a given page based on text).

Dependencies

* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EventLogging - Used for logging
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GuidedTour - Used for introductory
tours
* Read access to the MediaWiki API is required
* phpredis extension installed on the same machine, and Redis installed on some
machine that can be accessed.

That means phpredis needs to be (re-)compiled against 2.6 if
upgrading from 2.4.

For the server, Ubuntu users can use the PPA at
https://launchpad.net/~rwky/+archive/redis

For phpredis, follow https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis#installation

Then add 'extension=redis.so' to php.ini and restart PHP-FPM (or other
process running PHP)

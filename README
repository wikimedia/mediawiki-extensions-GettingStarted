extensions/GettingStarted
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GettingStarted

The GettingStarted extension
* Creates a new special page, Special:GettingStarted,
  that is automatically shown on signup, and users can visit it at any time.
* Maintains lists of pages that need easy editing work based on article
  categories such as 'Category:All articles needing copy edit'
* Special:GettingStarted presents these tasks; if the user clicks one, it shows
  an article in that category with a taskbar that
  - invites the user to fix the article,
  - offers to show help (using GuidedTours),
  - links to another article in the same task.
  - allows the user to choose an alternate task/category.

To use:
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once( "$IP/extensions/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.php" );
* Categorize some wiki articles in the main namespace with the categories in
  $wgGettingStartedTasks.
* Create a new user to test.

Dependencies

* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CentralAuth - The CentralAuth
account creation flow is required
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EventLogging - Used for logging
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GuidedTour - Used for introductory
tours
* (optional) Read and write access to MediaWiki API must be enabled to avoid
showing the GettingStarted tour repeatedly to logged in users if they
 regularly visit Special:GettingStarted.
* phpredis extension installed on the same machine, and Redis installed on some
machine that can be accessed.

That means phpredis needs to be (re-)compiled against 2.6 if
upgrading from 2.4.

For the server, Ubuntu users can use the PPA at
https://launchpad.net/~rwky/+archive/redis

For phpredis, follow https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis#installation

Then add 'extension=redis.so' to php.ini and restart PHP-FPM (or other
process running PHP)

The GettingStarted page creates a new special page, Special:GettingStarted,
that is automatically shown on signup.  It can also be visited later at any time.

To use:
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once( "$IP/extensions/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.php" );
* Create a new user to test.

Dependencies

* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GuidedTour
* (optional) Read and write access to MediaWiki API must be enabled to avoid
showing the GettingStarted tour repeatedly to logged in users if they
 regularly visit Special:GettingStarted.

extensions/GettingStarted
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GettingStarted

The GettingStarted page creates a new special page, Special:GettingStarted,
that is automatically shown on signup.  It can also be visited later at any time.

To use:
* Put the extension files in your extension directory
* Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php
require_once( "$IP/extensions/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.php" );
* Create a new user to test.

Dependencies

* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EventLogging
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GuidedTour
* (optional) Read and write access to MediaWiki API must be enabled to avoid
showing the GettingStarted tour repeatedly to logged in users if they
 regularly visit Special:GettingStarted.
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PostEdit until core wgPostEdit is deployed
* phpredis extension installed on the same machine, and Redis installed on some
machine that can be accessed.

Since CategoryRoulette uses the two-argument version of
SRANDMEMBER, it requires Redis 2.6+ for both the server and
the PHP extension.

That means phpredis needs to be (re-)compiled against 2.6 if
upgrading from 2.4.

For the server, Ubuntu users can use the PPA at
https://launchpad.net/~rwky/+archive/redis

For phpredis, follow https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis#installation

Then add 'extension=redis.so' to php.ini and restart PHP-FPM (or other
process running PHP)
